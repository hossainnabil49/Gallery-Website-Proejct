# Gallery-Website-Project
Personal project I made that is a login based website, where the user can view artworks and view the artist's profiles. Added functionality such as a following system, like system, have user add art themselves and search functionality.
DIRECTIONS:
1. first in the terminal, do the following, npm install, this should install all the correct
packages to run the website
2. Run node .\database-initializer.js(this will initialize the database with the updated
gallery.json *thank you to discord user,Sean Gordon for providing artworks to be used
for the gallery.JSON )
3. Run node .\server.js
4. Use the following link to access: http://localhost:3000/
